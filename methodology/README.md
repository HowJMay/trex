Please give a look at [methodology page](https://youtube.tracking.exposed/methodology).


## Important links

[master profile](https://tracking.exposed/x/master.tar.gz), should be decompressed in `profiles`.

Every new collection you want to run should:

1. have a copy from `profiles/MASTER` to `profiles/thetestname`
2. have a file full or youtube URL in: `config/thetestname.watevr`, look at `config/example.txt`
3. execute `python3 bin/experiment1.py config/thetestname.watevr`
